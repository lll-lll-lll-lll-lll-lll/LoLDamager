know the damage you will inflict on any enemy champion, aka Damage Calculator for League of Legends

This program does not detect runes that the player is using, the damage you receive / send may be slightly different from the original damage.
"Bee Helper" doesn't use "ReadProcessMemory" or "Injectors" like Blitz.gg, "Bee Helper" uses just the Riot API and a little bit of math. you will not be banned if you use this.
